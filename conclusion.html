    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif; font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        1. In the first week, I began my yoga journey by exploring local yoga studios in my neighborhood. I attended introductory classes for two days, taking notes on different styles and techniques. After analyzing my experience, I realized the importance of proper alignment and breathing in yoga practice. To deepen my understanding, I planned a personal yoga program focusing on fundamental poses and breathing exercises. I decided to create a visual guide including diagrams of basic poses to aid my practice. The key aspects I focused on were:
        * Observing proper alignment in basic poses
        * Learning and practicing different breathing techniques
        * Understanding the connection between mind and body in yoga
        * Exploring the benefits of regular yoga practice
        * Developing a consistent yoga routine

        <br><br>

        2. In the second week, I delved deeper into various yoga styles to prepare for a more focused practice. I attended a local yoga workshop to understand different approaches, challenges in maintaining poses, and existing knowledge among practitioners. Analyzing insights from these sessions helped me identify trends in practice styles, the link between flexibility and consistent practice, and preliminary personal goals. Cultural aspects were addressed through research on yoga philosophy specific to different traditions. This knowledge informed the development of a personalized practice routine.
        <br><br>
        
        3. The third week was dedicated to developing a short yoga sequence for beginners. I started by finalizing a series of poses and breathing exercises, ensuring it would be accessible yet beneficial. I tested the sequence with a friend to refine its flow and clarity. The next day focused on perfecting my cues and transitions. I practiced guiding through the sequence and created a simple visual aid for reference. Day 3 involved setting up a quiet space for practice, ensuring it was well-organized and had all necessary props. On Days 4 and 5, I practiced the sequence daily, making notes on how it felt and where adjustments might be needed. Finally, on Day 6, I reflected on the experience and collected feedback from my practice partner to help refine the sequence for future use.
        <br><br>
        
        4. In the fourth week, I focused on understanding the physical and mental effects of my yoga practice. Using a journal, I tracked my progress, noting changes in flexibility, strength, and overall well-being. This involved gaining proficiency in self-assessment and mindfulness techniques to identify key benefits of regular yoga practice.
        <br><br>
        
        5. Week 5 was about exploring the broader impacts of yoga. I designed a visual representation of how yoga affected different aspects of my life, such as stress levels, sleep quality, and overall mood. I tracked these factors over time, illustrating how my yoga practice influenced my daily life. I also researched the historical context of yoga, creating a timeline of its evolution and how it has been adapted in modern times.
        <br><br>
        
        6. In the sixth week, I reflected on my yoga journey so far. I reviewed my journal entries and progress notes, uncovering interesting trends about how my practice has evolved. Now, it's time to analyze this information to understand how yoga has impacted my physical and mental well-being, any challenges I've faced in maintaining a regular practice, and how it has influenced my daily habits. With this knowledge, I can tailor the next phase of my yoga journey to effectively deepen my practice and possibly share my experiences with others.
        <br><br>
        
        7. In the seventh and eighth weeks, I worked on creating this webpage to document my yoga journey and showcase my progress through a gallery of images and reflections. This project has allowed me to visually represent my yoga experience and share my insights with others interested in starting their own yoga practice.</p><br><br>
